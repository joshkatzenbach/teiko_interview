DATABASE ANSWERS: 

1. Design and provide a database schema.

    Database Schema found in the file: database_schema.png

2. What would be some advantages in capturing this information in a database?

    Capturing all of this information is a database is essential so that it can be accessed later quickly and effienciently. By storing thousands of projects in the same database,
    it become rather trivial to compare trends and analyze data. Using simple queries we do all sort of calculations quickly. This allows us to easily iterate on the current product. 

3. Based on the schema you provide in (1), please write a query to summarize the number of subjects available for each condition.

    SELECT condition, COUNT(*) 
    FROM subjects 
    GROUP BY condition;

4. Please write a query that returns all melanoma PBMC samples at baseline (time_from_treatment_start is 0) from patients who have treatment tr1. 

    SELECT * 
    FROM samples 
    JOIN subjects 
        ON samples.subject_id = subjects.id 
    WHERE subjects.condition = 'melanoma' 
        AND samples.time_from_treatment_start = 0
        AND samples.treatment = 'tr1';


5. Please write queries to provide these following further breakdowns for the samples in (4).

    For the following three questions, I'll be inserting the code from above in as a subquery: 


    a. How many samples from each project?

        SELECT project_id, COUNT(*)
        FROM (*CODE FROM ABOVE*) AS previous
        GROUP BY project_id;

    b. How many responders/non-responders?

        SELECT response, COUNT(*)
        FROM (*CODE FROM ABOVE*) AS previous
        GROUP BY response;

    c. How many males, females?
        
        SELECT sex, COUNT(*)
        FROM (*CODE FROM ABOVE*) AS previous
        GROUIP BY sex;
